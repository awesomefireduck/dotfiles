#           XY PATH1 -> PATH2
#
#       where PATH1 is the path in the HEAD, and the " -> PATH2" part is shown only when PATH1 corresponds to a different path in
#       the index/worktree (i.e. the file is renamed). The XY is a two-letter status code.
#
#       The fields (including the ->) are separated from each other by a single space. If a filename contains whitespace or other
#       nonprintable characters, that field will be quoted in the manner of a C string literal: surrounded by ASCII double quote
#       (34) characters, and with interior special characters backslash-escaped.
#
#       For paths with merge conflicts, X and Y show the modification states of each side of the merge. For paths that do not have
#       merge conflicts, X shows the status of the index, and Y shows the status of the work tree. For untracked paths, XY are ??.
#       Other status codes can be interpreted as follows:
#
#       Â·   ' ' = unmodified
#
#       Â·   M = modified
#
#       Â·   A = added
#
#       Â·   D = deleted
#
#       Â·   R = renamed
#
#       Â·   C = copied
#
#       Â·   U = updated but unmerged
#
#       Ignored files are not listed, unless --ignored option is in effect, in which case XY are !!.
#
#           X          Y     Meaning
#           -------------------------------------------------
#                     [MD]   not updated
#           M        [ MD]   updated in index
#           A        [ MD]   added to index
#           D         [ M]   deleted from index
#           R        [ MD]   renamed in index
#           C        [ MD]   copied in index
#           [MARC]           index and work tree matches
#           [ MARC]     M    work tree changed since index
#           [ MARC]     D    deleted in work tree
#           -------------------------------------------------
#           D           D    unmerged, both deleted

#           A           A    unmerged, both added
#           U           U    unmerged, both modified
#           -------------------------------------------------
#           ?           ?    untracked
